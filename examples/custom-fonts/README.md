> [!IMPORTANT]
> This example only works for WXT v0.20.7 and above. For older versions, see [React Content Script UI Custom Font](https://github.com/wxt-dev/examples/tree/main/examples/react-content-ui-custom-font) example

In this example, we'll add custom fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to the popup and a ShadowRoot content script UI.

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
